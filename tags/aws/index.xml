They’re accessible via bastion hosts or via API (API Gateway &amp;amp; Lambda). Works well, but there’s one weird issue — cold lambda start time is over 10s sometimes. We experienced even 15s. This is not acceptable and I’m seeking for answers to my questions.
Does increased memory size help? Is this huge cold start time VPC related? Is there a difference when we do use another language?</description></item><item><title>AWS journey — EC2 Container Service</title><link>https://www.zrzka.dev/aws-journey-ec2-container-service/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 Oct 2016 11:28:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.zrzka.dev/aws-journey-ec2-container-service/</guid><description>We were using (and we’re still it using for some services) Docker Cloud. Main problem with DC is that they can’t handle private subnets. EC2 instance must be in the public subnet and that’s not what we want. Hooray (irony), we have to switch to the EC2 Container Service. Try to explain this to our business department. Additional time for infrastructure. Can handle it, but it’s tough sometimes.
Docker images repository Cloud Formation Template This step is optional, but we’re trying to leverage as many as possible AWS services.</description></item><item><title>AWS journey — Cloud Formation</title><link>https://www.zrzka.dev/aws-journey-cloud-formation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Oct 2016 00:00:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.zrzka.dev/aws-journey-cloud-formation/</guid><description>As a small start up, we’re playing with lot of technologies and we try to choose the best ones. Okay, sometimes not because of money constraints, but we’re trying. One day, can’t remember when it was, we decided to go with AWS. Not just EC2 instances for Docker Cloud, but full stack. I mean API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, ECS, DynamoDB, etc. Counted them, AWS provides 51 services. Some of them are perfect, some of them still needs polishing, but they’re pretty good generally speaking.</description></item><item><title>AWS Lambda &amp; API Gateway Error Handling</title><link>https://www.zrzka.dev/aws-lambda-api-gateway-error-handling/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Apr 2016 00:00:46 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://www.zrzka.dev/aws-lambda-api-gateway-error-handling/</guid><description>It’s fragile and kind of terrible. Let’s look at it. We have a function named lambda. It has one argument named action (enum with allowed values data, exception or timeout). First thing we would like to do is to validate input via schema. Then we would like to return custom error message (and status code) if it’s invalid or do other things based on the action argument value.
Here’s the code, just to demonstrate how it works.</description></item></channel></rss>

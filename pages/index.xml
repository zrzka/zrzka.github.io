Don&amp;rsquo;t expect a lot of articles on this site. I don&amp;rsquo;t write too much:
it was already said elsewhere, I have nothing to say, it takes too much time to write something meaningful (like this post for example) and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to spend more time with my family. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t write at all, just the frequency is very low.</description></item></channel></rss>

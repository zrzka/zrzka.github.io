I don&amp;rsquo;t write too much - a) it was already said elsewhere, b) I have nothing to say, c) it takes too much time to write something meaningful (like this post for example). It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t write at all, just the frequency is low.

FAQ Where&amp;rsquo;s the old blog Trashed. Yes. I just kept couple of most interesting articles (like VPC &amp;amp; AWS lambda performance) and rest was deleted. Why? It was old, outdated and who wants to read my rants about Swift 2 for example?</description></item></channel></rss>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll have a talk about balena at mDevCamp 2019 conference on May 31st, 2019.
This talk will consist of two parts:
 I&amp;rsquo;ll explain what the balena is, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you the whole workflow (demo).  If you have any questions, just let me know in advance and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to answer them.
Would like to prepare? You can start learning at What is balena?</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re trying new ideas for our startup and they need to be tested quickly. With real users. We&amp;rsquo;re just connecting available dots without reinventing the wheel if there&amp;rsquo;s existing solution for particular problem. Here&amp;rsquo;s an example what we just did in a few days.
Our flagship Frank is well accepted by customers. They like it, because it&amp;rsquo;s simple (survey with five questions) and it gives them good results. When compared to another performance review tools (like 360, etc.</description>

      <description>My career is kind of colourful. I was working on aircraft systems, VoIP HW &amp;amp; SW, developing Linux kernel drivers, Linux distributions, OpenOffice.org and many other low level (RTOS) &amp;amp; high level (desktop applications) stuff. Linux nerd. I said enough one day. I wanted to just work and wasn’t willing to continue wasting my time with searching how to workaround this and that. Bye bye Linux, did spend nice 10 years with you.</description>

      <title>AWS journey — API Gateway &amp; Lambda &amp; VPC performance</title>
      <link>https://www.zrzka.dev/2016/10/31/aws-journey-api-gateway-lambda-vpc-performance/</link>

      <description>We decided to hide some EC2 instances in private subnets (VPC). They’re accessible via bastion hosts or via API (API Gateway &amp;amp; Lambda). Works well, but there’s one weird issue — cold lambda start time is over 10s sometimes. We experienced even 15s. This is not acceptable and I’m seeking for answers to my questions.
 Does increased memory size help? Is this huge cold start time VPC related? Is there a difference when we do use another language?</description>

      <title>AWS journey — EC2 Container Service</title>

      <description>We were using (and we’re still it using for some services) Docker Cloud. Main problem with DC is that they can’t handle private subnets. EC2 instance must be in the public subnet and that’s not what we want. Hooray (irony), we have to switch to the EC2 Container Service. Try to explain this to our business department. Additional time for infrastructure. Can handle it, but it’s tough sometimes.
Docker images repository Cloud Formation Template This step is optional, but we’re trying to leverage as many as possible AWS services.</description>

      <description>As a small start up, we’re playing with lot of technologies and we try to choose the best ones. Okay, sometimes not because of money constraints, but we’re trying. One day, can’t remember when it was, we decided to go with AWS. Not just EC2 instances for Docker Cloud, but full stack. I mean API Gateway, Lambda, EC2, ECS, DynamoDB, etc. Counted them, AWS provides 51 services. Some of them are perfect, some of them still needs polishing, but they’re pretty good generally speaking.</description>

      <title>AWS Lambda &amp; API Gateway Error Handling</title>

      <description>It’s fragile and kind of terrible. Let’s look at it. We have a function named lambda. It has one argument named action (enum with allowed values data, exception or timeout). First thing we would like to do is to validate input via schema. Then we would like to return custom error message (and status code) if it’s invalid or do other things based on the action argument value.
Here’s the code, just to demonstrate how it works.</description>

      <description>Developer.
I don&amp;rsquo;t write too much - a) it was already said elsewhere, b) I have nothing to say, c) it takes too much time to write something meaningful (like this post for example). It doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean that I don&amp;rsquo;t write at all, just the frequency is low.

FAQ Where&amp;rsquo;s the old blog Trashed. Yes. I just kept couple of most interesting articles (like VPC &amp;amp; AWS lambda performance) and rest was deleted. Why? It was old, outdated and who wants to read my rants about Swift 2 for example?</description>
